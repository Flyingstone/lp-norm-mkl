	full_cvx.m - code for the reduced version of the optimization problem solved via cvx
	cuttingplane_cvx.m - code for the 2-part optimization problem where the intermediate optimization problems are solved via cvx
	cuttingplane_sedumi.m - code for the 2-part optimization problem where the optimization problem involving alpha is directly solved and the optimization problem involving theta is solved using SeDuMi
	runRegressionTest - code that generates gaussian data, creates kernels and runs the optimization algorithms
		1. How to Run?
		> testtype = ?; codevector = [1 1 1]; runRegressionTest
		where testtype can take value between 1 to 5
		2. How to look at the regression plot?
		> plot(x, y, x, ypred1, x, ypred2, x, ypred3)
		ypred1 holds predictions from full cvx, ypred2 holds predictions from 2-part cvx, ypred3 holds predictions from sedumi based cutting plane
		3. How to check the optimal values?
		> [eta1 eta2 eta3]
		eta1 is optimal value from full cvx, eta2 is optimal value from 2-part cvx, eta3 is optimal value from sedumi based cutting plane
		4. How to check optimal solutions?
		> [theta1 theta2 theta3]
		> [alpha1 alpha2 alpha3]
		as before (theta1, alpha1) obtained from full cvx and so on.
